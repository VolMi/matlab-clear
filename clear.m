function clear( varargin )
%intercept amok calls to clear() in interactive mode
%
% So you do something in an interactive Unix Shell and type 'clear'
% to get rid of some annoying ouput.
% Then you switch to MATLAB, do the same and lose all your current work.
% Syntax madness... o_O
%
% It feels fundamentally wrong that MATLAB's clear() assumes
% that 'no input' == 'everything'. This function is the workaround, effective only
% for interactive calls. I would like to apply this to script calls, too, but
% this breaks a lot of matlab's own code.
%
% This function intercepts all calls of clear() (hence the name...) and
% decides what to do based on the given arguments and whether it was called
% from the command window or not.
%
% in pseudo code:
%
% IF  < NO ARGUMENT, I.E. CLEAR EVERYTHING >
%
%       IF  < IS INTERACTIVE >
%
%           < ASK USER EXPLICITLY IF THEY WANT TO ERASE EVERYTHING >
%
%           IF  < NO, THEY DON'T >   % <-- safety net
%               RETURN
%           END
%       END
% END
%
%  <DEFAULT CLEAR CODE>
%
%
% Note:
%   'clear all' or 'clear variables' will still clear everything immediately, because
%   it was specifically asked to do so!
%
% This relies on undocumented MATLAB/JAVA code to get the last command from
% the history. If the command fails (maybe very old or very new MATLAB),
% this is caught by try/catch and clear behaves completely like the
% builtin function. So, don't rely on it, just have it as a safety net!
%
% Usage
% =====
%       Save this m-file anywhere in your matlab path such that it has
%       precedence over the builtin implementation. That is, make sure
%       that
%           >> which clear
%       returns the path to this file.
%
% SEE ALSO
% clear

% blame: Michael VÃ¶lker

% The actual clear() has to be called as builtin( 'clear', 'var1', 'var2', ...).
% And this has to done in the calling workspace and with whatever size
% of varargin.
% So this function ends up a bit messy but it's about the least-messy way
% I could figure.
